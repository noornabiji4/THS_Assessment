    <p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been<br>
    the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of<br>
    type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also<br>
    the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s<br>
    with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with<br>
    desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
    <p>
    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical<br>
    Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at<br>
    Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur,<br>
    from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cities of the word in classical literature,<br>
    discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de<br>
    Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This<br>
    book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of<br>
    Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
